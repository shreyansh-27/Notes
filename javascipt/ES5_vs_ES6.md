# EcmaScript 

It's the way everything in modern JS is modeled after
It's the specification that every JS engine needs to implement
That doesn't mean every engine does include every feature present in EcmaScript, they can choose what to and what not to keep


## EcmaScript 5
The first important version of Ecmascript was ES5

Supported by every browser there is, including Internet explorer
**One important thing to note is that it only had var, no let and const**
